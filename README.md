# logistic-regression
In this part of the exercise, we have build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university or not. We want to determine each applicant's chance of admission based on their results on two exams. You have historical data from previous 
applicants that you can use as a training set for logistic regression. For each trainingexample,we have the applicant's scores on two
exams and the admissions decision.Our task is to build a classifcation model that estimates an applicant's probability of admission
based the scores from those two exam.
Data is being provided in txt format and we can call the functions to see the results.
